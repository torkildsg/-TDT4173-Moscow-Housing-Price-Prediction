# TDT4173-Machine-Learning

This project was done in collaboration with Henrik Gundersen and Emil Ekornr√∏d.

In this project we predicted the prices of apartments in Moscow.
Real estate is a popular investment vehicle and can be pretty lucurative.
Whether you're an individual looking for a place to call home or an investor looking for a profitable opportunity,
being able to appraise assets accurately - or at least better than the next guy - can be of huge value.

The dataset consists information about over 33,000 apartments in Moscow. 
It contains around 30 variables that encode data such as location, facilities, and building information.
Our task was to do analysis, feature engineering, and ultimately create models that can reliably predict the listed price of both low- and high-end apartments.
